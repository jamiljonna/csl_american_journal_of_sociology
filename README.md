=================================

CSL citation style for American Journal of Sociology

I created this citation style using "Chicago Author-Date" as a template. With each version I'll try to document all of the changes I make.

v.0.0.1

1. Added "Ibid." support.
2. Properly integrated page numbering using "p.", "pp.", etc.
