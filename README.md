CSL citation style for American Journal of Sociology

=================================

I created this citation style using "Permafrost and Periglacial Processes" as a base.


v.0.0.2

1. Changed base CSL style to  and Perilacial Processes
2. Redid inline styles to get page numbering and Ibid support added
3. Added support for chapter point locators
4. Made "issue" display in bibliography
5. Closed up space around colon separators between vol. no. and pp.

v.0.0.1

1. Added "Ibid." support.
2. Properly integrated page numbering using "p.", "pp.", etc.
